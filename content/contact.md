Please check the FAQ that can be found in WinFellow's User Manual before contacting us, it is usually the fastest way to find a solution to your problem.

There is a WinFellow specific support forum at the [English Amiga Board](http://eab.abime.net/forumdisplay.php?forumid=28), which is also monitored by us.

You could also make use of the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/petschau/winfellow/issues).

Any comments on how to improve WinFellow are welcome!

You can also contact us directly by sending an email composed in English language to [Torsten Enderling](mailto:torsten.enderling@gmail.com). Due to copyrights, all emails concerning Kickstart ROM images and ADF floppy images will be ignored. 

You can buy Kickstart ROM images from [Cloanto](http://www.amigaforever.com).
